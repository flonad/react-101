# React Router

Now that we have all the features of our application, we now want to make the design more mobile friendly. 

We will split our app into three different pages :
- one page with the list of wine regions,
- one page with the list of the wines of the region selected on the regions page,
- one page with the details of the wine selected on the wine list page.

We will use react-router to manage the routing of the application. You can follow the [tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial) on the official website to complete this step.

It's a bonus, so there is no additional help :)
